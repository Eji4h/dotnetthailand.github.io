# Initialize Node.js project.
- Create a project folder and initialize a project with the following command:
```sh
$ mkdir sass-webpack-project
$ cd sass-webpack-project
$ yarn init -y
```
- You can change a folder's name to any name as you want.
- You will have an auto generated `package.json` file in the current working directory.

# Add required packages to the project.
```sh
yarn add --dev \
  sass \
  sass-loader \
  webpack \
  webpack-cli \
  css-loader \
  mini-css-extract-plugin \
  webpack-remove-empty-scripts
```

### Note
- If you use [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/), you can install npm packages with `yarn workspace your-package-name add --dev space-separated-value-of-npm-packages`, e.g.
```sh
yarn workspace your-package-name add --dev \
  sass \
  sass-loader \
  webpack \
  webpack-cli \
  css-loader \
  mini-css-extract-plugin \
  webpack-remove-empty-scripts
```
- We use `sass` package in this example because `node-sass` has been deprecated.

# Create Webpack configuration file.
- Create `webpack.config.js` at the same level as package.json
- Please note that we will use Webpack version 5 configuration.
- Add the following content to `webpack.config.js`:
```js
// This Webpack is only for building Sass (.scss) to CSS
const path = require('path');
// This plugin will extract CSS into separate files
const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require('mini-css-extract-plugin');
// This plugin removes empty scripts generated by usage
const RemoveEmptyScriptsPlugin = require('webpack-remove-empty-scripts');

// input file: src/scss/style.scss
// output file: wwwroot/styles/style.css

module.exports = {
  entry: {
    style: './src/scss/style',
  },
  mode: 'development',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'wwwroot/styles'), // An output dir must be an absolute path.
    filename: '[name].js',
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['.scss']
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.scss$/,
        use: [
          // Extract to CSS file
          MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader,
          // Translates CSS to CommonJS and ignore solving URL of images
          'css-loader?url=false',
          // Compiles Sass to CSS
          'sass-loader',
        ],
        exclude: /node_modules/,
      },
    ]// End rules
  },
  plugins: [
    new RemoveEmptyScriptsPlugin({ verbose: true }),
    new MiniCssExtractPlugin({
      // Configure the output of CSS.
      // It is relative to output dir. Only relative path works, absolute path does not work.
      filename: '[name].css',
    }),
  ],
};

```
- You can change an entry point and an output folder to match your environment.
- In this example, our entry point file is `src/scss/style.scss` and output is `wwwroot/styles/style.css`.
- This configuration uses `RemoveEmptyScriptsPlugin` to remove unnecessary output JavaScript file.

# Build with Webpack.
- Add a custom script to `package.json`.
```json
  "scripts": {
    "build": "webpack --mode=production",
    "dev": "webpack --mode=development",
    "watch": "webpack --watch"
  },
```
- Please make sure you have SCSS file as an entry point file.
- Build the project with the following command.
```sh
yarn dev
```

### Note
- If you use [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/), you can build your package with `yarn workspace your-package-name dev`, e.g.

# Check your output CSS file.
- You will find your output `.css` file in an output folder that you specify in `webpack.config.js`.
- For our example, the output file is in `wwwroot/styles` folder.

# Our project structure
```
$ tree -I 'node_modules' sass-webpack-project
sass-webpack-project/
├── package.json
├── src
│   └── scss
│       └── style.scss
├── webpack.config.js
